Orpheus AI is a tool that can be used by artists to predict the genre(s) of song lyrics.

Due to size constraints, the actual model used for prediction is not stored in this repository. Please download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1325gRbGG6aR6Kp9EEA44WbyvoASXGjKu) and place the entire `combo` folder in the root directory.
